A high-performance **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline that transforms unstructured web content into a queryable, citation-backed knowledge base. By grounding LLaMA 3.1 in real-time web data, this assistant eliminates hallucinations and provides verifiable technical answers.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application is decoupled into two primary logic loops: **Knowledge Ingestion** and **Contextual Inference**.



### 1. The Ingestion Loop (ETL)
* **Extraction:** `WebBaseLoader` pulls raw HTML/Text from user-provided URLs.
* **Transformation:** `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` segments data into 1500-character chunks with semantic overlap to preserve context across boundaries.
* **Vectorization:** Local embeddings via `Alibaba-NLP/gte-base-en-v1.5` map text to a 768-dimensional vector space.
* **Persistence:** ChromaDB manages the local vector store, allowing for efficient similarity searches.

### 2. The Inference Loop (RAG)
* **Semantic Search:** User queries are vectorized and compared against the vector store using Cosine Similarity.
* **Augmentation:** The top 8(k = 8) most relevant context chunks are injected into a specialized system prompt.
* **Generation:** Groq-hosted LLaMA 3.1 synthesizes a response strictly based on the provided context.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔗 **Live Web Ingestion**: Instantly build a knowledge base from any valid HTTP/HTTPS source.
- 🧠 **Zero-Hallucination Logic**: System prompts enforce strict grounding—if the answer isn't in the context, the AI won't guess.
- 📚 **Source Attribution**: Transparent citation tracking showing exactly which URLs influenced the answer.
- ➗ **High-Fidelity Math Rendering**: Custom regex-based pipeline identifies and cleans LaTeX artifacts, rendering complex equations perfectly via `st.latex()`.
